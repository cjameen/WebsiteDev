  <h2><em><U>Frequently Asked Questions<em></U><h2>
    <p><b>Q. The status of my order is 'Awaiting fulfillment'. What does this mean?</b>
<p><br>This means we have received payment for your order and it has been passed on to our packing department who will pick and pack the order. Once this has been done the order will be updated to 'Shipped'. </br><p>

<br><p><b>Q. The status of my order is 'Awaiting payment'. However, the funds have already been taken from my account.</b></p></br>
<P>This can sometimes happen with Paypal payments. It is likely we will have received payment and the order will be processed as soon as possible. The status will then be updated to shipped. However, if the status has not been updated to shipped after 48 hours please contact us with your order number and details so we can track your order and payment. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE PAYMENT AGAIN OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE CHARGED TWICE.<p>

<br><p><b>Q. I have received an email asking me to complete my order. However, the funds have already been taken from my account.</b></p></br>
<P>It is likely we will have received payment and the order will be processed as soon as possible. The status will then be updated to shipped. However, if the status has not been updated to shipped after 48 hours please contact us with your order number and details so we can track your order and payment. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE PAYMENT AGAIN OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE CHARGED TWICE.<p>

<br><p><b>Q. The status of my order is 'Shipped'. However, I have not yet received my order.</b></br>

<P>If you have paid for guaranteed next day delivery please ensure you placed your order before 3pm the previous day before contacting us. If your order was placed after 3pm then the order will not have been despatched until the next working day so will be delivered to you two working days after you placed your order. EXAMPLE: If you ordered at 4pm on a Tuesday it would not be despatched from us until Wednesday so would not be with you until Thursday. If you have not received your order by the end of the day that it was expected please contact us.<p>

<p>If you have paid for standard delivery your order is normally shipped within 1-3 days. However, there can sometimes be delays which mean it can take up to 7 working days before you receive your order. If you have not received your item(s) after 7 working days from placing your order please contact us.<p>

<p>If you have paid for international delivery your order is normally shipped within 3-5 days. However, there can sometimes be delays which mean it can take up to 14 working days before you receive your order. If you have not received your item(s) after 14 working days from placing your order please contact us.<p>

<br><p><b>Q. I Have returned an item but have not had confirmation that it has been received.</b></p></br>
<P>Unfortunately due to the large number of returns we receive we are unable to confirm if your item has been received before we process the refund/exchange. It can take up to 28 days before you are issued with a refund or exchange. <p>

<br><p><b>Q. It has been more than 28 days and I have not received a refund or exchange.</b></p></br>
<P>If it has been more than 28 days since you returned the item to us and you have not yet received a refund or exchange please contact us and we will do our best to try and locate your return and provide you with your refund. <p>

<br><p><b>Q. The status of my order is 'Refunded' but the money is not back in my account.</b></p></br>
<P>If you have paid by Paypal we will refund the money directly to your Paypal account which will automatically update the status of your order to 'Refunded'. However, it can take up to 7 days before the funds are showing in your account. If 7 days have passed since the status of your order was updated to 'Refunded' then please contact us.<p>

<p>If you have paid by debit or credit card then the funds normally show in your account instantly. However, please allow 48 hours before contacting us.<p>

<br><p><b>Q. The status of my order is 'Refunded' but I have not requested a refund.</b></P></br>
<P>This sometimes happens when you are given a refund in the difference of postage costs. Particularly with Paypal payments as the status automatically updates to refunded even if it is only a partial refund that has been made. If you have not requested a postage refund or full refund then please contact us ASAP otherwise your order may not be despatched. </p>
